# React Native WhatsApp Fork

## Run project

To start the development server and run your project:

```
npx expo start
```

Alternate to using Expo Go, if you are building more than a hobby project or a prototype, make sure you [create a development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/). You can either [locally compile your project](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-builds-with-expo-dev-client) or [use EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

To locally compile your app, run:

```
# Build native Android project
npx expo run:android

# Build native iOS project
npx expo run:ios
```
